# geocache-minesweeper

This is a project I made for my Dad after finishing Dev Academy.

It uses much of what I learned on the back end - and nothing I learned on the front end (as it was simple enough that React wasn't necessary).

It allowed me to get more practice with SQL databases and with deployment.

The game is hosted on [heroku](https://kaygeedee-mine.herokuapp.com/) and the geocache page is located [here](https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC783Z9_minesweeper).

To run the backend yourself, download and install.  You will need the following environment variables in a .env file to run the server locally:

width=20
height=20
mines=88
east=123
south=456
